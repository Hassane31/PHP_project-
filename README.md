# PHP Learning Journey 🚀

This repository contains all my PHP practice codes.

I am learning PHP from YouTube tutorials and pushing every video I watch as a commit, so this repo represents my learning progress step by step.

## 📌 Purpose
- Practice PHP basics
- Understand concepts by coding
- Track my progress through commits

## 🛠 Tools
- Language: PHP
- Editor: Visual Studio Code
- OS: Kali Linux

## 📂 Structure
Each commit = one tutorial / one concept.

Examples:
- variables
- conditions
- loops
- functions
- forms
- database (later...)

## ⚠️ Note
This code is for learning purposes only, not production ready.

Feel free to explore the commits history to see my evolution.
